# Rotating Connect Four

A unique twist on the classic Connect Four game, where players can not only drop pieces but also rotate the entire grid to change the game dynamics. This command-line version of Connect Four allows two players to compete in a strategic and exciting game, adding an extra layer of complexity and fun with the rotation feature. This project was developed as part of a C programming course.

## Features
- Classic Connect Four gameplay with a 7x7 grid
- Ability to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise and 180 degrees
- Ability to save the current game at any given time
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface
- Real-time validation of moves and win conditions

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the game script executable in your shell (a.out).
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to drop pieces and rotate the grid.
4. The first player to align four of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
